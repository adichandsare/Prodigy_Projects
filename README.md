Project Title: Temperature Conversion Program

Description:

This project involves building a program that facilitates temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
The program prompts the user to input a temperature value along with the original unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
It then performs the necessary conversions to convert the temperature to the other two units.
Finally, it displays the converted temperature values to the user.
Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language used for developing the temperature conversion logic.
Command Line Interface (CLI): Used for user interaction and input/output operations.
Conversion formulas: Implemented within the program to convert temperatures between different scales.
This project provides a simple and intuitive way for users to convert temperatures across different units, enhancing their understanding and usability.

Project Title: Guessing Game

Description:

This project involves building a guessing game where the user is challenged to guess a randomly generated number.
The program generates a random number within a specified range.
It prompts the user to input their guess.
The program compares the user's guess to the generated number and provides feedback (whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct).
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
Upon winning, the program displays the number of attempts it took the user to win the game.
Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language used for developing the guessing game logic.
Random module: Used to generate random numbers for the game.
Command Line Interface (CLI): Utilized for user interaction and input/output operations.
Conditional statements: Implemented to compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback.
This project provides an interactive and entertaining way for users to test their guessing skills, enhancing their engagement and enjoyment.
